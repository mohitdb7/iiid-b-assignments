    Hello, I am your laptop assistant. Please feel free to ask me about laptop recommendations. 

    You can tell me about your needs like 

    - what is the purpose of the laptop
    - Do you need heavy processing laptop
    - Do you need it for travel purposes, etc

    Please note: I do not take inputs to talk to about any specific brand as I am suppose to be non-biased. 
    Once I find a good recommendatio for you, then you can ask me about that laptop.

    Let's start!!!

 Hi, this is Mohit Dubey and I am looking for a coding laptop
----------------------------------------Shop Assitant----------------------------------------

Hi Mohit! That's great!  Coding laptops can be quite versatile. To help me find the perfect one for you, could you tell me a bit more about your coding needs?  For example, what kind of coding do you do?  Do you work with large datasets, complex software, or primarily web development?  Knowing this will help me understand your requirements for processing power, storage, and other features.

 I will working on Machine Learning, Deep Learning and NLPs and models I will run locally
----------------------------------------Shop Assitant----------------------------------------

Okay, that's helpful!  So you'll be doing a lot of computationally intensive work with Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLPs.  This means you'll need a laptop with strong processing power and a dedicated GPU.  

To make sure I can find the best fit for you, could you tell me your budget for the laptop?  Knowing this will help me narrow down the options and find something that meets your needs without breaking the bank.

 Something less than 2.5 lacs
----------------------------------------Shop Assitant----------------------------------------

Okay, I understand.  Unfortunately, finding a laptop that can handle the demands of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLPs within a budget of 2.5 lacs INR might be challenging.  These tasks require powerful processors and dedicated GPUs, which often come at a higher price point. 

To give you the best possible recommendations, could you tell me if you're open to considering a slightly higher budget?  If not, we can explore some options that might be suitable for lighter workloads or consider alternative solutions like cloud computing. 



{'result': 'No', 'reason': 'Missing keys'}

----------------------------------------User----------------------------------------
 Yes, I am fine with higher budget
----------------------------------------Shop Assitant----------------------------------------

Great!  That opens up a lot more possibilities.  Since you'll be doing a lot of demanding work with Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLPs, I'd recommend a laptop with a powerful processor and a dedicated GPU.  

To make sure I can find the perfect fit for you, could you tell me your maximum budget?  Knowing this will help me narrow down the options and find something that meets your needs without breaking the bank.

 3 lacs
----------------------------------------Shop Assitant----------------------------------------

Okay, that's a great budget to work with!  With 3 lacs, we can definitely find a laptop that can handle your Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLP workloads.  

To make sure I can find the perfect fit for you, I have a few more questions:

1. **How important is portability to you?**  Do you need a laptop that's lightweight and easy to carry around, or will you primarily be using it at a desk?
2. **How important is display quality to you?**  Do you need a high-resolution display with vibrant colors, or is a standard display sufficient?

Knowing this will help me narrow down the options and find a laptop that meets your needs and preferences.

 Portability and display is not a priority
----------------------------------------Shop Assitant----------------------------------------

Okay, that's helpful!  Since portability and display quality aren't a priority, we can focus on finding a laptop with the best possible performance for your Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLP workloads. 

Based on our conversation, here's what I've gathered about your needs:

* **GPU Intensity:** High (You'll be doing a lot of demanding work with Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLPs)
* **Display Quality:** Medium (Not a priority)
* **Portability:** Low (Not a priority)
* **Multitasking:** High (You'll likely be running multiple programs and processes simultaneously)
* **Processing Speed:** High (You'll need a powerful processor to handle your workloads)
* **Budget:** 300000 INR

I'm confident that with this information, I can find you a great laptop that meets your needs.  Do you have any other preferences or requirements I should be aware of? 



{'result': 'Yes'}
