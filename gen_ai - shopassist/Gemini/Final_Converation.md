 Hi, this is Mohit Dubey and I am looking for a coding laptop
----------------------------------------Shop Assitant----------------------------------------

Hi Mohit! That's great!  Coding laptops can be quite versatile. To help me find the perfect one for you, could you tell me a bit more about your coding needs?  For example, what kind of coding do you do?  Do you work with large datasets, complex software, or primarily web development?  Knowing this will help me understand your requirements for processing power, storage, and other features.

 I will working on Machine Learning, Deep Learning and NLPs and models I will run locally

Okay, that's helpful!  So you'll be doing a lot of computationally intensive work with Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLPs.  This means you'll need a laptop with strong processing power and a dedicated GPU.  

To make sure I can find the best fit for you, could you tell me your budget for this laptop?  Knowing your budget will help me narrow down the options and find something that meets your needs without breaking the bank.

 Which one is best suited?
----------------------------------------Shop Assitant----------------------------------------

Based on your profile, the **ASUS ZenBook Pro** seems like the best fit. Here's why:

* **High GPU intensity:** The ZenBook Pro boasts an NVIDIA RTX graphics card, which is ideal for demanding tasks like gaming and video editing. 
* **High Multitasking:** With 64GB of RAM, the ZenBook Pro can handle multiple applications and programs simultaneously without any lag.
* **High Processing Speed:** The i9 Intel CPU with a 3.1 GHz clock speed ensures lightning-fast performance for all your tasks.
* **Medium Portability:** The ZenBook Pro is a 15.6" laptop, making it suitable for carrying around, although it's not the lightest option.
* **Medium Display Quality:** The OLED display offers excellent color accuracy and contrast, meeting your medium display quality requirement.
* **Budget:** The ZenBook Pro fits comfortably within your budget of Rs. 250,000.

While the Dell Precision 5550 also offers high performance, its higher price and Ubuntu operating system might not be ideal for your needs. The Dell XPS 15, while a great option, falls short in terms of GPU power compared to the ZenBook Pro.
